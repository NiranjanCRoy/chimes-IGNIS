CHIMES Data
===========

This section describes the data files that contain the various reaction rate coefficients, photoionisation cross sections etc. that define the CHIMES chemical network. 

Note that the details discussed in this section are not required for actually running CHIMES. Once you have downloaded the data files, you only need to pass CHIMES the path to the directory where they are stored, and CHIMES will deal with loading and using these files internally, so most users can skip this section entirely. This will be of interest to those who want to look into the various chemical reactions and cooling and heating processes that go into the CHIMES chemical model in more detail.
