Chimes Plotter
--------------

The ``chimes-plotter.py`` python script can be used to plot the outputs from Chimes Driver. This makes it easy for new Users to quickly make simple plots from the Chimes Driver outputs and start exploring the results of the chemistry solver in simple physical set ups. 

To run ``chimes-plotter.py``, you need to pass it a parameter file as an argument, similarly to ``chimes-driver.py``. The various parameters are described in the :ref:`PlotterParameters_label` section below. The script can then be run as: 

``python chimes-plotter.py parameter_file``
