.. CHIMES documentation master file 

Welcome to the CHIMES User Guide
================================

The CHIMES chemistry module tracks the time-dependent non-equilibrium evolution of up to 157 ions and molecules. These chemical abundances are used to calculate the cooling and heating rates of the gas. 

This User Guide describes how to download the CHIMES code and data files, build it as a stand-alone library that can be run from a python script, and how to incorporate the CHIMES source code directly into your own hydrodynamics code. 

The details of the CHIMES model are described in `Richings et al. (2014a) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.440.3349R>`_ and `Richings et al. (2014b) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.442.2780R>`_.
